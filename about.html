              A back-to-nature heart buoyed Lewis G. Gazoul in crafting this ongoing adventure saga that has already 
              captivated the imaginations and hearts of many. Gazoul has always enjoyed the wilderness. He and his 
              family and friends have hiked, hunted and camped throughout the United States and especially all 
              over the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of the great state of Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The astonishing wonders of the outdoors became the context for a short bedtime story he whispered to 
              his two children.  Later, Lewis wrote that adventure episode onto a piece of paper, and from that 
              page grew his vision for the vast, mystical and wondrous land that is the setting for his first novel, 
              <i>Druids of the Faerie: Gather the Champions Book One & Two</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The still-evolving land and story remain true to the tale that enchanted his children, allowing 
              their imaginations to flourish. And the adventures continue powerfully when reading about our 
              faithful champions in Lewis G. Gazoul's novels to come!
            </p>
            <p>
              Lewis makes his home with his family in the City of Grosse Pointe, Michigan.
